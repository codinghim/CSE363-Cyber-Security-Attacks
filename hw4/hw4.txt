Homework 4: Buffer Overflow Exploitation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this assignment you will write exploits for some trivial vulnerable
programs. The goal of all exploits is to launch a shell as root. Each script
should prepare the appropriate malicious input and launch the vulnerable
program with it to get a shell. The exploits should be launched from a
non-root shell. You can use any language you prefer for the exploit scripts.


0) Preparation

You can develop your exploits in any environment you want, but your final
exploit should work on the 32-bit Kali Linux we have used for the previous
assignments (better not 'apt-get upgrade' the system - this will make your
exploits more easily reproducible).

- Disable ASLR using the follow command:
root@kali:~# echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space

- Change the default shell from 'dash' to 'zsh':
root@kali:~# rm /bin/sh
root@kali:~# ln -s /bin/zsh /bin/sh

The reason for this is that in Kali, /bin/sh is actually a symbolic link to
/bin/dash. Modern shells, including dash, have the following security measure:
if they detect that they have started as SUID root, they drop their privileges
(reset EUID to UID). In part 2 below, this would drop the spawned shell back
to testuser despite vuln2 having the setuid bit on, i.e., you won't get a
root shell but just a regular user shell when using /bin/dash.

- Create a normal user account and switch to it:
root@kali:~# adduser testuser
root@kali:~# usermod -a -G sudo testuser
root@kali:~# su testuser


1) Shellcode Injection

Your goal is to exploit the following simple program, when compiled with the
following commands:

testuser@kali:~$ cat vuln1.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {

  unsigned int i;
  char buf[256];

  for (i=0; i<strlen(argv[1]); i++) {
    if (((unsigned int)argv[1][i] >= 0x68) && ((unsigned int)argv[1][i] <= 0x6e)) {
      argv[1][i] = 'x';
    }
  }

  strcpy(buf, argv[1]);

  printf("Input: %s\n", buf);
  return 0;
}

testuser@kali:~$ gcc -g -fno-stack-protector -z execstack -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -o vuln1 vuln1.c
testuser@kali:~$ sudo chown root vuln1
testuser@kali:~$ sudo chgrp root vuln1
testuser@kali:~$ sudo chmod +s vuln1

The main challenge here is to use an appropriate shellcode that will withstand
the mangling of any '/bin/sh' or similar ASCII string used in the shellcode by
the for loop.


2) Ret2libc

Your goal is to exploit the following simple program, when compiled with the
following commands:

testuser@kali:~$ cat vuln2.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {

  char buf[256];

  strcpy(buf, argv[1]);
  printf("Input: %s\n", buf);

  return 0;
}

testuser@kali:~$ gcc -g -fno-stack-protector -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -o vuln2 vuln2.c
testuser@kali:~$ sudo chown root vuln2
testuser@kali:~$ sudo chgrp root vuln2
testuser@kali:~$ sudo chmod +s vuln2

This is a classic ret2libc exploit. Make sure to include a call to exit()
after launching your shell, for graceful termination of the program.


3) Chained ret2libc/ROP

Your goal is to exploit the following simple program, when compiled with the
following commands:

testuser@kali:~$ cat vuln3.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {

  char buf[256];

  seteuid(getuid());     /* Drop privileges */

  strcpy(buf, argv[1]);
  printf("Input: %s\n", buf);

  return 0;
}

testuser@kali:~$ gcc -g -fno-stack-protector -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -o vuln3 vuln3.c
testuser@kali:~$ sudo chown root vuln3
testuser@kali:~$ sudo chgrp root vuln3
testuser@kali:~$ sudo chmod +s vuln3

The main challenge here is that the program drops its root privileges, so
using the previous exploit this time will give just a regular user shell. You
can still exploit this program by chaining a call to seteuid(0) before
spawning your shell ('man seteuid' for more details).


What to submit:

A tarball with:
- a Makefile for generating the vulnerable binaries
- the three exploits
- a README file with a brief description of your strategy in each case


Hints

- You can either handcraft your own shellcode to avoid the mangled bytes, or
  use an encoder (e.g., from Metasploit) to generate a shellcode that doesn't
  contain those bytes.

- Libc has all the ingredients you need for the code reuse exploits. For
  example, you can use execve() or system() to launch /bin/sh, while the
  string "/bin/sh" itself (which has to be passed as an argument to those
  functions) also exists inside the library.

- The argument to seteuid should be zero, which means that you cannot simply
  include it as part of your ROP payload as strcpy() will stop at a zero byte.
  You will thus need to use a few ROP gadgets to initialize this argument in
  its appropriate location on the stack.

- You can use ROPgadget or any other gadget finding tool (Ropper, ROPium,
  ROPshell, among many others) to find the gadgets you need (for generating
  the zero value on the stack, and adjusting the stack for calling the next
  function). Remember that you can look for gadgets in any executable memory
  segment of the process.

- When switching to /bin/zsh (Part 0 above), the simple shellcode we've been
  using in our tutorials so far does not work anymore. Try this one instead,
  or just search online for any other one:
  
  char sc[] = "\x31\xc0\x50\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69"
              "\x6e\x89\xe3\x50\x53\x89\xe1\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80";
