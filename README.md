### CSE363: Offensive Security

Hands-on course with the goal of understanding various security problems in depth, through a more adversarial way of thinking. By focusing on finding and exploiting vulnerabilities, the course will cover a broad range of topics, including the ethics of offensive security, reverse engineering, software vulnerability discovery and exploitation, malicious code analysis, network traffic interception and manipulation, reconnaissance and information gathering, physical security, and social engineering. All topics will be covered from a highly practical perspective, following a hands-on approach and tutorial-like sessions, along with programming assignments.
